# ai-surveillance
Built a full Intelligent monitoring system capable of detecting humans, weapons, restricted area breaches, and missing persons in real time. Integrated YOLOv8 with ByteTrack for tracking, and FaceNet for face recognition. Designed a user-friendly Gradio UI for real-time alert visualization and annotation.


# üß† Real-Time Restricted Area Monitoring & Missing Person Detection System

An **AI-powered real-time surveillance system** that integrates **Human Detection**, **Weapon Detection**, **Restricted Area Intrusion Monitoring**, and **Missing Person Identification** ‚Äî all in one intelligent video analytics application.

Built using **YOLOv8**, **ByteTrack**, and **FaceNet**, this system processes uploaded videos (or live streams) and identifies security breaches and missing persons automatically.

## üöÄ Project Overview

An AI-powered real-time surveillance system integrating Human Detection, Weapon Detection, Restricted Area Monitoring, and Missing Person Recognition. Processes videos and identifies security breaches automatically: 

### üßç 1. Human Detection & Tracking
- YOLOv8 Human Detector (Medium to Nano): trained on ~50,000 human images.
- Detects and tracks humans in real-time using **YOLOv8 (distilled lightweight model)**.
- Each person is assigned a **unique ID** using **ByteTrack**.

### üî´ 2. Weapon Detection (Gun & Knife) 
- YOLOv8 Weapon Detector (Large to Small): trained on ~120,000 weapon images (guns & knives).
- Detects weapons using a **custom YOLOv8-Small model** distilled from a 120k weapon dataset.
- Automatically raises red alerts when a weapon is detected.

### üö∑ 3. Restricted Area Monitoring 
- User paints a **restricted zone** directly on the video‚Äôs first frame (using Gradio ImageEditor).
- System monitors entry of humans into that region in real-time.
- Intrusion triggers visual and textual alerts in the final output video.

### üïµÔ∏è 4. Missing Person Recognition
- YOLOv8 Face Detector (Medium to Nano): trained on ~40,000 face images.
- Upload a **reference image** of the missing person.
- The system uses **Face Detection (YOLOv8)** and **Face Recognition (FaceNet + Face Alignment)** to locate them in the video.
- Displays a bold yellow **‚ÄúMATCH FOUND!‚Äù** overlay and highlights the identified person.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Architecture
Architecture Overview ‚Äì Intelligent Video Surveillance App

1. User Input:
   - Upload a video.
   - Select mode: normal, restricted, or missing_person.
   - Optionally draw Restricted Area or upload reference face image.

2. Preprocessing Module:
   - Extract first frame from video.
   - Generate ROI mask for Restricted Area mode.
   - Preprocess reference face for FaceNet embedding.

3. Detection Module (YOLOv8):
   - Human Detector (Nano) - detect & track humans.
   - Weapon Detector (Small) - detect guns/knives.
   - Face Detector (Nano) - detect faces for missing person recognition.

4. Tracking Module (ByteTrack):
   - Assign unique IDs to humans.
   - Track humans frame by frame.

5. Face Recognition Module (FaceNet + Face Alignment):
   - Align detected faces.
   - Match with reference image to detect missing persons.

6. Alert & Annotation Module:
   - Draw bounding boxes and labels.
   - Flag Restricted Area breaches.
   - Highlight detected weapons and missing persons.
   - Output annotated video with alerts.
